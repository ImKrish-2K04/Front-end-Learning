      // now we are going to learn about cookies in javascript...

      // in java script you can fetch cookies stored in your browser using 'document.cookie'

      // and also you can add cookie in the existing cookies set by using that syntax...

      // currently in our browser where we are going to see our practicle, there is not any cookies are preset...

      // so here we are going to see the preset cookies first then we will set our one, and then again will see it...

      /*
      document.cookie = 'firstName=Krishna';
      alert(document.cookie);
      */

      // here we are going to see 2 methods, which are really very important in the context of passing information by cookies or sessions or in any context. when you are trying to store a string value in cookie, it will checks wether any special characters are exists in the string or not... if exists then it will not set our {key,value} pair properly...

      // to set any special characters as a key or value you can use encodeURIComponent() method which accepts a string and encodes its special characters so we can set them, and to see the original one, we can use decodeURIComponent() method... let's see it not by practicle...

      /*
      let key = encodeURIComponent(prompt("enter your key"));
      let value = encodeURIComponent(prompt("enter your value"));
      let key_value = `${key}=${value}`;
      document.cookie = key_value;
      alert(document.cookie);
      */

      // NOTES : 

      // the {name,value} pair, after encodeURIComponent should not exceeds 4kb ... and the total no. of cookies per domain is limited to around 20 cookies and the number is depended on browser also...
