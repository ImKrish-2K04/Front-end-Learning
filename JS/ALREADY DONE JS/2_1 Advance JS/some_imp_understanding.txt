here we are going to understand some important topics of JS and NodeJS...

first of all we are going to understand about event loop..
----------------------------------------------------------

The event loop is indeed a fundamental concept in JavaScript's runtime environment, responsible for managing the execution of asynchronous tasks. However, it's not an infinite loop in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a loop that continuously checks the call stack and the task queue for tasks to execute.

Here's a breakdown of the event loop process:

    Call Stack: The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the currently executing function calls in JavaScript. When a function is called, it's added to the top of the call stack. When a function returns, it's removed from the stack.

    Task Queue: JavaScript runtime environments (like browsers or Node.js) have task queues where asynchronous tasks are placed after their completion. These tasks include events like DOM events (clicks, mouse movements), timers (setTimeout, setInterval), and I/O operations.

    Event Loop: The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the task queue. If the call stack is empty, it takes the first task from the task queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution. This process continues indefinitely, creating the illusion of concurrent execution.

Now, microtasks and macrotasks:

    Microtasks: Microtasks are tasks with higher priority compared to macrotasks. They are executed immediately after the current synchronous execution phase (i.e., after the call stack is empty and before rendering). Examples of microtasks include Promises (resolved or rejected), MutationObserver callbacks, and process.nextTick in Node.js.

    Macrotasks: Macrotasks have lower priority compared to microtasks. They are typically tasks that require more processing time and are executed asynchronously. Examples of macrotasks include setTimeout, setInterval, requestAnimationFrame, and DOM events.

In summary, the event loop processes tasks from the task queue, executing microtasks before macrotasks. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively managing asynchronous code and avoiding common pitfalls like callback hell or incorrect task prioritization.

FOR MORE DEEP UNDERSTANDING:
============================

1. Call Stack:
   - When you call a function that contains synchronous code (including synchronous parts of asynchronous functions), it's added to the call stack.
   - Each function call is executed sequentially, with the current function running until it completes.

2. Asynchronous Operations:
   - When an asynchronous operation is encountered (e.g., fetching data from a server, setTimeout), it doesn't block the main thread. Instead, it's offloaded to the browser's APIs (in the case of the browser) or the Node.js runtime (in the case of Node.js).

3. Task Queue:
   - Once the asynchronous operation completes (e.g., data is fetched, setTimeout timer expires), the callback associated with that operation is placed in the task queue.

4. Event Loop:
   - The event loop's job is to constantly monitor the call stack and the task queue.
   - If the call stack is empty, it takes the first task from the task queue and adds it to the call stack for execution.
   - This process continues indefinitely, with the event loop ensuring that tasks are processed in the correct order: microtasks before macrotasks.

So, when you make a function call that includes an asynchronous operation:

    - The function call itself is added to the call stack and executed synchronously.
    - Any asynchronous operations within that function (e.g., setTimeout, Promise) are initiated and offloaded to the runtime environment.
    - Once those asynchronous operations complete, their corresponding callbacks are placed in the task queue.
    - The event loop continuously checks the call stack and task queue, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order.
