    ! What are Reflow and Repaint?
    ! Why are they important, and how can we optimize our script's performance by understanding them?

    ? First of all, `reflow` and `repaint` are **very crucial** concepts, especially for **interview preparation** and writing **high-performance JavaScript code**.

    ? **Reflow** is a **computationally expensive** process where the browser calculates the **position and dimensions** of elements on the page. Every time an element's size, position, or layout is changed, reflow occurs.

    ? **Repaint**, on the other hand, is the process of **rendering** elements **pixel by pixel** on the screen. It happens when changes affect the element’s appearance **without changing its layout** (like color changes).

    ? These two processes are different but related. **Without reflow, repaint cannot happen** because the browser first needs to determine the layout before it can render elements properly.

    ? If we understand how to **reduce the frequency of reflows and repaints**, we can **significantly improve our script’s performance** and minimize **execution time**.

    ? Below, we have demonstrated **three different approaches** in the 'script' tag to highlight the impact of reflow and repaint.

    ? **Approach 1 (Worst Performance)**: Here, we are **directly modifying the DOM** inside a loop. Since each `p` element is appended to the body **one by one**, the browser performs **100 reflows and 100 repaints**.

    ? **Approach 2 (Best Performance in Most Cases)**: Instead of updating the DOM repeatedly, we first create a `div`, append all `p` elements to it, and then append the `div` to the `body`. This **reduces reflow & repaint from 100 to just 1**.

    ? **Approach 3 (Alternative Optimization)**: Similar to Approach 2, but instead of a `div`, we use a **DocumentFragment**. The benefit of a fragment is that it **does not trigger reflow/repaint while appending elements**, and only **one reflow/repaint happens when added to the DOM**. It can sometimes be even faster than Approach 2.

    <script>
      // ! Approach 1 (Direct DOM Manipulation - Slowest)
      let startTime1 = performance.now();
      for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        let para = document.createElement("p");
        para.textContent = `Para no. ${i}`;
        document.body.appendChild(para);
      }
      let endTime1 = performance.now();
      let time1 = endTime1 - startTime1;

      // ! Approach 2 (Using a Single Div - Faster)
      let startTime2 = performance.now();
      let myDiv = document.createElement("div");
      for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        let para = document.createElement("p");
        para.textContent = `Para no. ${i}`;
        myDiv.appendChild(para);
      }
      document.body.appendChild(myDiv);
      let endTime2 = performance.now();
      let time2 = endTime2 - startTime2;

      // ! Approach 3 (Using Document Fragment - Fastest)
      let startTime3 = performance.now();
      let fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
      for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        let para = document.createElement("p");
        para.textContent = `Para no. ${i}`;
        fragment.appendChild(para);
      }
      document.body.appendChild(fragment);
      let endTime3 = performance.now();
      let time3 = endTime3 - startTime3;
