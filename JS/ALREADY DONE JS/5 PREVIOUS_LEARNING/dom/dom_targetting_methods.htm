      //we can target DOM object in three ways..
      //1. with ID,  2. with Class,  3. with Attribute

      //1. with ID => document.getElementById("id_name");
      //2. with Class => document.getElementsByClassName("class_name");
      //3. with Attribute => document.getElementsByTagName(attribute_name);
