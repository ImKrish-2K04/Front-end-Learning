    <h1>JS - TuTs</h1>
    <p>
      This is the tutorial about how the immediate invoked function helps us to
      solve<br />
      very much bigger problems appears suddenly and there is no way to resolve
      it..
    </p>

      //in this TuT we are learning that if we are linking more than one files and if there is same properties in many files then how we can resolve that problems....
      //this can be done with the help of the immediate invoked function..
      //this function makes these properties local to them and it aquires the less memory spaces and executes faster because it executes at the time of declaration without jumping one line to another line..
      //understand it with very much focus..
      //there is one commented code is given inside one of the both files so you can check them by un-commenting them and running them.. when you do this in console inside chrome it shows an error because inside another file the property is local and the same property can not be declared more than one time ... it can be declared at only once..
      // but this is when you have to link 2 or more files to your html and there is same variables or things are there....
