      //it is not any other but it is a different variant of an anonymous function
      //II function is more efficient in saving of memory than a normal anonymous function..
      //means when it is declared at the same time it is executed and at the end of the execution it will leave the occupied memory..

      (function () {
        console.log("Hello, Good Morning..");
      })();

      //to create an immediate invoked function we have to create an anonymous function , put it inside a round bracket and at the end of the round bracked we have to use another round bracket same as the function following and use a semicolon..
