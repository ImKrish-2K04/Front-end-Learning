      //one very imp thing is 'arguments' is not an array but an object that behaves in similar way as array..
      //now we see the 'arguments' Array that is always exists in all functions when is created..
      //using this you can pass multiple arguments to this function without creating its parameters..   let's see this..

      function add() {
        if (arguments.length == 0) {
          console.log("NoValuePassedException"); //this is not an exception but just message so we can understand..
        } else if (arguments.length == 1) {
          console.log("NotEnoughNumberException");
        } else {
          let i = 0;
          let sum = 0;
          for (i; i <= arguments.length - 1; i++) {
            sum += arguments[i];

      add(10);
      add();

      //there is a very interesting point which is very imp to notice..
      //we can store any function inside a variable but when we are doing this stuff we do not have to use parenthesis
      //after the function name..   but imp point is we have to use that variable in same way as we are uses functions

      let summation = add;
      summation(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9); //44

      //what if we wanna access any argument?..  argument[i].. you have seen it....in loop....
