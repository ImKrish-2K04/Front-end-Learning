      //Anonymous Functions

      //Anonymous functions are those functions which has no name or identity,
      //Anonymous function is use when you need to store any function inside any variable,
      //because when you stores a function in a variable then why you give a name to that function,
      //when we assigns a function to the variable you have to use that variable in the same way as we execute function.

      //when we assigns functions to the variables then it called a "Function Expression"..

      /*
      let greet = function () {
        console.log("Hello, Good Morning..");
      }; //"Function Expression"

      setTimeout(greet, 3000);
      */

      //greet();

      //if we want to print output after certain amount of time, there is one function provided by JS..
      //Syntax = > setTimeOut(Function-Name , time-in-milliSecond);   // 1000ms = 1s...

      //we can pass whole anonymous function directly as argument so no memory will be occupied..
      //Example is below :  that will not occupies the memory and run more efficiently and fastly
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("Hello, Good Morning..");
      }, 3000);
