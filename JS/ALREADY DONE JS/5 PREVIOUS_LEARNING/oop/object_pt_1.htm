      //we can create objects in similar way as array..

      //let obj.Name = {};    ->    object creation definition

      //we can create an object property with a white-space included but it is not recommended..use only [] withit
      //it is like -> starting -> 'property-Name' <-ending ,....  use comma and write name inside comma..
      //the quoted property with a whitespace is works with only [] not with dot operator so remember this..

      let person = {
        firstName: "Krishna",
        lastName: "Makwana",
        "full Name": "Makwana Krishna Jasminbhai",
      };

      //let's access it, but as an instruction : it can be accessed in two ways..
      console.log(person.lastName); //first way
      console.log(person["full Name"]); //second way

      console.log(person);

      //let's modify the values of a property of an object
      person.firstName = "bhumika";
      console.log(person["firstName"]);

      //let's create a new property of an object
      //this way we can create properties even after creating an object as per our sudden needs..
      person.age = 37;
      console.log(person);

      //now understands how to delete object properties..
      //syntax -> delete objectName.propertyName;     here delete is a keyword that is not used as any identifier
      delete person["full Name"];
      console.log(person);

      //if you wanna to check that any specific property is exists in your object or not then use ..
      //'in' keyword..    ->    syntax    ->    console.log('prop.-needed-to-find' in objectName);
      //it returns true if pro. exists else it will returns false
      console.log("height" in person);
      console.log("firstName" in person);

      //to know the properties of any objects we can use for-in loop..
      //with properties you also want to check value then use [] and access it as below specified..
      //when we are using the real name of properties then only we uses quotes inside [] but when we are
      //using for-in loop then we are not using real props. so we are not using quotes...
      let i = 0;
      for (let vars in person) {
        i++;
        console.log("property " + i + " = " + vars + " : " + person[vars]);
      }

      //we can create an object in another way using new keyword..
      let prs1 = new Object();
      prs1.Name = "Makwana Krishna";
      console.log("using a new keyword : " + prs1.Name);

      //here the discussion about the object related some important things are ends...
